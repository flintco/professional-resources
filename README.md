### Onboarding

- [Onboarding and the Cost of Team Debt](https://www.kateheddleston.com/blog/onboarding-and-the-cost-of-team-debt)
  - If technical debt is the eventual consequence of poor design, team debt is the eventual consequence of not training employees correctly which leads to sub-optimal team performance.
  - Onboarding is complete when team member is "reliably independent"
  - Teams that onboard badly get less work done with the addition of new engineers

### Problem Solving

- [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/)
  - A powerful tool to get unstuck is explaining your thinking to someone (or an inanimate object) that doesn't have knowledge on the subject.
- [Thirty Minute Rule](https://daniel.feldroy.com/posts/thirty-minute-rule)
