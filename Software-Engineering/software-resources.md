### Onboarding

- [Onboarding and the Cost of Team Debt](https://www.kateheddleston.com/blog/onboarding-and-the-cost-of-team-debt)
  - If technical debt is the eventual consequence of poor design, team debt is the eventual consequence of not training employees correctly which leads to sub-optimal team performance.
  - Onboarding is complete when team member is "reliably independent"
  - Teams that onboard badly get less work done with the addition of new engineers

### Operating Systems
- [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)
  

### Problem Solving

- [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/)
  - A powerful tool to get unstuck is explaining your thinking to someone (or an inanimate object) that doesn't have knowledge on the subject.
- [Thirty Minute Rule](https://daniel.feldroy.com/posts/thirty-minute-rule)
  - Creating the 30 minute rule solves the issues of two groups: it forces people who ask questions immediately to stick with the problem and encourage people who are hesitant to ask questions.

  - SSO and MFA are becoming more of an expectation for companies to use to authorize users
  - Sessions are how users are kept logged in. Implemented with either cookies or JWT.
  - Also discuesses other ideal functionality such as bot protection, user experience of login process, email verification, and identity linking
